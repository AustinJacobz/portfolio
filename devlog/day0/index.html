          <h2>The first day I started by Creating a simple space ship in blender.</h2>

          </figure>
          <h2>Since I plan on having the ship walkable, I made sure to have it large enough for the player to walk around and inverted the normals so the collision mesh would work. In the future if I plan on being able to leave the ship I will make the outside. Or maybe I should do it anyways for promotional art.</h2>
          <h2>The next part was exporting the ship as fbx, and assigning the materials to things such as the windows and screens. Since the game is still a prototype, I will not be doing any texturing in substance painter/armorpaint</h2>

          </figure>
          <h2>The next step was to write some simple movement code for the ship and slap a rigidbody on that badboy. I decided to not make the ship kinematic as the asteroids will be and I want the ship to be able to bounce off of them. I am also using a box collider as the calculations are easier for a mobile phone to handle compared to a full mesh collider. I also hopped into audacity and made a sound for the ship engines that will get effected by the velocity.magnitude of the ship</h2>

          <h2> Then for the asteroid spawning I made a simple script that will spawn the asteroids with a random rotation within a defined range. The spinning of the asteroids and the properties of their makeup are kept on the asteroid prefab. I am currently using basic cubes for the models while I work on the logic. After I am finished with the base game-loop I will then model some propper mobile-friendly asteroid models for each type of asteroid.</h2>

          <h2>That's all I have to share for week 1. Next I plan on adding basic mining an upgrade shop for more powerful lasers and maybe a save system so your progress will save.</h2>
          <h2>after I have the basic game systems set up I will allow you to walk around your ship, and maybe even interact with some little fun things I sprinkle around ;)</h2>
